[h1]Mod Everything Reloaded for War of the Chosen.[/h1]

[b]ATTENTION, ITS A COMMON MISCONCEPTION THAT THIS MOD ADDS ATTACHEMENT SLOTS.
THIS MOD DOES NOT ADD ANY SLOT. IT JUST TWEAKS THE UI THAT YOU CAN MOD ITEMS OTHER THAN PRIMARY WEAPONS
THIS IS BECAUSE ITS A META MOD NOT A GAMEPLAY MOD[/b]

If you want to change the number of slots for weapons you can use

Mod really everything!

It is released with the kind approval of /dev/null, 
who does not continue Mod Everything.

Includes everything of the orginial mod does (secondary slot, armor slot, heavy weapon slot) plus support for attachments in the
utility item slot. This is e.g. needed for LW2 utitlity pistols.

But it is also possible to make attachement mods for vests or any other utility item.

NOTE: This mod just makes it possible to add attachments, it doesnt offer any on its own.
Its a mod other mods can depend on to offer new attachments.

[h1]DONT USE BOTH MODS![/h1]
If you are using this, unsubscribe to "Mod Everything".

[h1]Credits[/h1]
The original implementation is work of /dev/null.
I just added utility item support.
Thank you for letting me continue this mod /dev/null!
